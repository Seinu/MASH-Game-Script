M.A.S.H. Game script randomly selects options listed in MASH.txt.

Instructions for changing MASH.txt:
1. Begin and end each line with a semi-colon(;)

2.on the first line of an addition put the question such as gender thus forming ;GENDER; caps or no caps as an example.

3.on the line below this put the options with or without a tab/space/etc. for organization such as Male and female putting a semi-colon(;) after each option

4.A addition should take this format:
;GENDER;
;	Male;	Female;

All fields have no limits on text and can be as many or as few questions and/or options as necessary.
